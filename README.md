I created a user data management portal (CRUD) using React, a powerful and efficient application that enables seamless management of user data.
This portal allows me to perform basic CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, and Delete - on user data, simplifying data administration tasks.
With a user-friendly interface, I can easily add new users, view existing user information, modify user details, and delete users as needed, 
all while leveraging React's robust features and scalability.
